## Technologies Used

### 1. **Tailwind CSS**
   - A utility-first CSS framework that allows for the creation of custom layouts through classes. It's used to style components and make the interface responsive across different devices.

### 2. **Bootstrap**
   - A CSS framework that provides pre-defined components and styles to quickly and consistently create a modern and responsive interface.

### 3. **Popper.js**
   - A JavaScript library used to manage pop-up elements like tooltips and dropdowns, enhancing the usability of the application. It’s especially useful in combination with Bootstrap for precise positioning of these elements.

### 4. **JavaScript**
   - JavaScript is the primary language for the application's logic, responsible for managing the interaction between modules and interface elements, such as the quiz game and the video game.

### 5. **HTML and CSS**
   - **HTML**: Provides the structure of the pages.
   - **CSS**: Used to adjust and customize styles, complemented by Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.

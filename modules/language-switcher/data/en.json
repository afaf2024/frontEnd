  "whowearepage-title": "Why We Fight:",
  "whowearepage-description": "Protecting the truth in the digital age. In today’s information age, we are bombarded with a constant flood of news. But, is all of this true? Unfortunately, no. We face a growing threat: fake news. Fake news goes beyond misleading headlines. It consists of entirely fabricated information often disguised as legitimate news sources. This makes them even more dangerous as they can easily be manipulated through biased framing or selective omission of facts. We are not only bombarded with fake texts, but also fake images, videos, and more. The consequences of fake news are real and can be far-reaching. They can influence public opinion on critical issues, affect elections, and even incite violence. That’s why we’re launching this project. We believe education has the power to fight back. Join us as we raise awareness about fake news and equip everyone with the tools to distinguish truth from fiction.\n"
